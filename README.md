## Get started

_A quick description how your project can be used, including where the relevant resources can be obtained from.
Put into another file if too big._

### Noteworthy

* Dropwizard does not support Java6, so despite the camunda standard compiler settings, this has do be done with targetJDK=1.7


## Resources

* [Issue Tracker](link-to-issue-tracker) _use github unless you got your own_
* [Roadmap](link-to-issue-tracker-filter) _if in terms of tagged issues_
* [Changelog](link-to-changelog) _lets users track progress on what has been happening_
* [Download](link-to-downloadable-archive) _if downloadable_
* [Contributing](link-to-contribute-guide) _if desired, best to put it into a CONTRIBUTE.md file_


## Roadmap

_specify a short list of things that yet need to be done (unless you organize it elsewhere)_

**todo**
- add feature B
- integrate with technology X

**done**
- add feature A
